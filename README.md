# Project Imperial
This is an inspired mash-up of a few of my favourites. This will be heavily
inspired by games like Age of Empires II, Empire Earth, Starcraft II, and
Supreme Commander.

However, at this current moment, all that is being developed is a game engine.

## Technologies
The game will be built in C++11 with OpenGL. The final product is aimed at linux
users. I will be mainly developing on Arch Linux.

### Libraries
All of these libraries are either installable for an official or aur package.

 - GLM
 - GLFW
 - FreeImage
